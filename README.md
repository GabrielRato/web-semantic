# web-semantic
A simple app built on Jena/Fuseki serving a Flask/Python 

We'll be using this docker file to make install Fuseki more easy: https://hub.docker.com/r/stain/jena-fuseki/

Now just to make sure everything is working fine, upload some data on fuseki, example: https://old.datahub.io/dataset/geonames-semantic-web

With everything fine, is time for the python side. Install this: https://github.com/RDFLib/sparqlwrapper

Just run example_select.py and u should see it!
